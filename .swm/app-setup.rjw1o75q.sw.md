## File Structure

# File Structure

The file structure of the `imgminify.co` repository follows a specific convention to ensure organization and maintainability. This section provides an overview of the file structure and explains how different components are organized within the repository.

The main files and directories in the `imgminify.co` repository include:

*   `src`: This directory contains all the source code for the application.

*   `src/App.js`: This file is the entry point of the application and serves as the main component.

*   `src/components`: This directory contains reusable components used throughout the application.

*   `src/services`: This directory contains service files that handle specific functionality or API calls.

*   `src/utils`: This directory contains utility functions and helper files.

*   `public`: This directory contains static assets such as images and favicon.

The file structure follows a modular approach, where related files are grouped together in directories. This helps in organizing the codebase and makes it easier to locate and maintain specific components or functionality.

For example, to clear the image list and reset the saved count, you can refer to the code snippet from `src/App.js`:

```javascript
const clearList = () => {
  setImageList([]);
  setSaved(0);
};
```

By following this file structure convention, it becomes easier to navigate and understand the codebase of the `imgminify.co` repository.
